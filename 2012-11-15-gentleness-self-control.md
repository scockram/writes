Gentleness and self control
===========================

* Galatians 5:22-26
* What we doing: G+SC
* **Way in:** Who do we know who is gentle; people we personally know or examples from popular culture, maybe try to stay clear of Bible people for now. Think of *why* they are gentle. Spider diagram these people on some paper.
* *Maybe:* Define gentleness: Having an even temperement.

Gentleness
----------

**NO ESV PLEASE**

* 2 Cor 10v1a **Keep finger here please**. The *meakness* and *gentleness* of Christ. We need to know what the gentleness of Christ is.
* Is Christ meak and gentle. Examples!? Donkey riding,
* Examples: Matt 11vv28-30, 12vv15-21, 21v5
* What does it mean to be "JC-gentle."
* 2 Cor 10vv1-6. Gentleness of Christ: Waging war, demolishing strongholds, taking captive, punishment. How can we use this *warlike imagery* with the idea of JC-gentleness.

* Phil 4vv2-7. What attitudes help us grow in gentleness that is evident to all? Rejoicing! Know where the Lord is! By not anxious! Praying to God! Being filled with the peace of God! It is guarded!!
* *Maybe:* Share times when we want this characteristic to be *evident to all*

* 1 Pet 3vv13-16. Evangalising with *gentleness* and *respect*.
* Why? (so they know we are different, see that God is powerfully at work in our attitudes and thinkings), How? Only do things that our conscience.
* How does this go down with the non-Christians. Be real init. **STEVE TO COME WITH EXAMPLE**
