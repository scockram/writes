Gentleness and self control
===========================

* Galatians 5:22-26
* What we doing: G+SC - Need to blurb this a little

Gentleness
----------

### No ESV Please.

* **Way in:** Who do we know who is gentle; people we personally know or examples from popular culture, maybe try to stay clear of Bible people for now. Think of *why* they are gentle. Spider diagram these people on some paper.
* *Maybe:* Define gentleness: Having an even temperement.

### 2 Cor 10v1a - *Keep finger here please*

* The *meakness* and *gentleness* of Christ. We need to know what the gentleness of Christ is.
* Is Christ meak and gentle. Examples!? Donkey riding,
* Examples: Matt 11vv28-30, 12vv15-21, 21v5
* What does it mean to be "JC-gentle."
* 2 Cor 10vv1-6. Gentleness of Christ: Waging war, demolishing strongholds, taking captive, punishment. How can we use this *warlike imagery* with the idea of JC-gentleness.

### Phil 4vv2-7

* What attitudes help us grow in gentleness that is evident to all? Rejoicing! Know where the Lord is! By not anxious! Praying to God! Being filled with the peace of God! It is guarded!!
* *Maybe:* Share times when we want this characteristic to be *evident to all*

### 1 Pet 3vv13-16

* Evangalising with *gentleness* and *respect*.
* Why? (so they know we are different, see that God is powerfully at work in our attitudes and thinkings), How? Only do things that our conscience.
* How does this go down with the non-Christians. Be real init. **STEVE TO COME WITH EXAMPLE**

Self-Control
------------

Probably not going to have time to blurb this... But don't want it to feel like a tack on to the study on gentleness. Argubably one of the more important fruits of the spirit, as it is the final bookend (with love being the first). May want to expand on this more.

### Prov 16v32, 25v28

* Wisdom literature: How to be wise.
* Why is self-control so esteemed in the Bible, particulary in wisdom literature

### Titus 2vv11-14

* What is the unusual link here.
* God's grace in Jesus and self control.
* **Explore this a lot;** if there is time I think it is really interesting.

### Luke 4vv1-13

* JC in the wilderness.
* What can we learn from Jesus rebuking temptation itself?
* Is the very definition of self-control

### Small group split (2-3) to discuss/pray

* Where we are experiencing growing self-control
* where we are in need of more of the Spirit's self control
* Pray
* Remember we also need His gentleness.
